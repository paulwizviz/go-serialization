# Hex Encoding

The `hex` package in Go's standard library provides functions for encoding and decoding data in hexadecimal (base 16) format. Hexadecimal encoding represents binary data in a readable string format using characters `0-9` and `a-f`. Each byte of data is represented as a two-character string.
